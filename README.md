### Title
Flask Blog Application with API Integration

### Description
Flask-based blog application that integrates an external API to fetch and display blog post data. It includes routes to showcase all blog posts on the main page and to provide detailed information about each post.

- requests: An elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, used for fetching data from the API.
